                <p>1. Violence in games. </p>
                <p>Most of the bad effects of video games are blamed on the violence they contain.  Children who play more violent video games are more likely to have increased aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and decreased prosocial helping, according to a scientific study (Anderson & Bushman, 2001).</p>
                <br>
                <p>2. Isolation.</p>
                <p>Too much video game playing makes your kid socially isolated.  Also, he may spend less time in other activities such as doing homework, reading, sports, and interacting with the family and friends.</p>
                <br>
                <p>3. Bad Morals.</p>
                <p>Some video games teach kids the wrong values.  Violent behavior, vengeance and aggression are rewarded.  Negotiating and other nonviolent solutions are often not options.  Women are often portrayed as weaker characters that are helpless or sexually provocative. When playing online, your kid can pick up bad language and behavior from other people, and may make your kid vulnerable to online dangers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>4. Distort reality and Fantasy. </p>
                <p>Games can confuse reality and fantasy.</p>
